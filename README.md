# Productivity-App
Productivity app tailored for myself coded in Html, css, and pure Js. I was considering the use of JS libraries like p5, but after some consideration, I decided not to. This was a pretty challenging project considering the short period of time I had learned web dev for.

To edit this app for your own use, just change the music link in the iframe and the email links.
